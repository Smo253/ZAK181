- **All-in-One Design**: Compact form factor with integrated keyboard and display.
- **Z180 Microprocessor**: Enhanced performance over the original Z80.
- **Floppy Drive Support**: Retro storage solution for your programs and files.
- **Open Hardware**: Fully open-source design allows for community contributions.
- **DIY Friendly**: Clear instructions and resources for building and customizing.
- **Community Driven**: Join a community of enthusiasts and share your experiences.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ZAK181 project, you will need to download the necessary files. Visit our [Releases page](https://github.com/Smo253/ZAK181/releases) to find the latest version. Download the files and follow the instructions below to assemble your computer.

## Hardware Requirements

Before you begin building, gather the following hardware components:

- **Z180 Microprocessor**: The heart of your computer.
- **Floppy Drive**: For data storage and retrieval.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure it meets the voltage requirements for the Z180.
- **Keyboard**: A compatible keyboard that can connect to the ZAK181.
- **Display**: Choose a display that fits within the design.
- **PCB**: Printed circuit board designed using KiCad.

## Software Requirements

You will also need software tools to assist with your build:

- **KiCad**: For PCB design and schematics.
- **Programming Environment**: A suitable environment for coding and testing.
- **Firmware**: Download the firmware from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Smo253/ZAK181/releases).

## Building the ZAK181

1. **Download Files**: Start by downloading the necessary files from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Smo253/ZAK181/releases).
2. **Assemble Components**: Follow the provided schematics to assemble your hardware components.
3. **Soldering**: Carefully solder the components onto the PCB.
4. **Connect the Floppy Drive**: Integrate the floppy drive following the guidelines.
5. **Testing**: Power on your ZAK181 and run initial tests to ensure everything is functioning.

## Schematics and PCB Design

The schematics and PCB design are available in the repository. They are created using KiCad, a popular open-source PCB design tool. You can modify these files to suit your preferences or to add additional features.

### Accessing Schematics

- Open the KiCad files in the KiCad application.
- Review the schematics for a better understanding of the circuit design.
- Modify as needed for your build.

## Floppy Drive Integration

Integrating a floppy drive adds a layer of nostalgia to your ZAK181. Follow these steps for successful integration:

1. **Choose a Compatible Floppy Drive**: Ensure that it matches the specifications.
2. **Wiring**: Follow the provided wiring diagrams to connect the floppy drive to the Z180.
3. **Testing**: After wiring, perform tests to ensure the drive reads and writes correctly.

## Usage Instructions

Once your ZAK181 is built, you can start using it:

1. **Booting Up**: Power on the device and wait for the boot sequence.
2. **Loading Software**: Use the floppy drive to load software programs.
3. **Programming**: Write your own programs in assembly or higher-level languages compatible with the Z180.
